+ **Project summary**: 

	+ In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop an *UrbanScout* shiny app on **NYC Accommodation Selection** using NYC open data released on the [NYC Open Data By Agency](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) website.
	+ The purpose of this app is to help college students easily visualize rental prices in NYC, along with other lifestyle statistics (e.g. crime rates, traffic, restaurants, etc.) to help them make an informed decision about their accommodations.
	+ Better Homes Means Better Learners!
