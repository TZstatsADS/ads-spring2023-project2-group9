### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals.

**Project 2: UrbanScout**

Team members: Xinming Pan, Ananya Tinaikar, Hongyan Zhou, Wenchang Zhu, Yiming Zhu

Summary:
+ In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop an *UrbanScout* shiny app on **NYC Accommodation Selection** using NYC open data released on the [NYC Open Data By Agency](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) website.
+ The purpose of this app is to help college students easily visualize rental prices in NYC, along with other lifestyle statistics (e.g. crime rates, traffic, restaurants, etc.) to help them make an informed decision about their accommodations.
+ Better Homes Means Better Learners!
